The models are available on links [model-all-50](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-61--PY3kWQ4xcymaNcq8fe_yUsNtY9L/view?usp=sharing), [model-all-34](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v2FcazXQKXqE8D1dNBX2Mz8wQsTUt8xs/view?usp=sharing), [model-features](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEwj9HMyIHMAf6NEPxjVfhZWTGIRS79M/view?usp=sharing). You have to edit model locations in notebooks, I can also provide separate models for all categories if needed.
